# Data-Visualization-Altair-1
In this project visualizations are implemented to solve the following tasks:
- How have the different departments of the UPC performed along the last years?
- How have the different research groups performed along the last years?
- Is there any correlation between department size and production?
- Do any departments produce more papers per person?
- How big is each area of research (the journal area of research in the dataset) in UPC?
- Is there an intersection between departments and areas of research?
- extra questions related to the COVID-19. 

The data used can be found on the csv, it was preprocessed using **OpenRefine**.

Every step considered is further explained in the jupyter notebook.
